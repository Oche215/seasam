          <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1">History of eContracts</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">eContracts have been used in various forms since the early 2000s.

        <p>Initially, they were created as a way to save time and money associated with traditional paper contracts. By eliminating printing, mailing, and physical signature costs, eContracts soon became popular amongst many organizations in the insurance and financial services industry.</p>
          <p>
            The introduction of blockchain technology has further improved the efficiency of eContracts. With blockchain, parties can store and access contracts securely and track changes over time using a distributed system of record keeping. This provides an extra layer of security for both parties involved in the contract process.
          </p>

          <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1">eContracts & Automation</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">In addition to the benefits mentioned above.

        <p>eContracts also enable organizations in a business transaction to automate certain processes. By automating tasks such as contract validation, compliance monitoring, and document management, organizations can save time and money while ensuring that their contracts are secure and up-to-date.</p>
